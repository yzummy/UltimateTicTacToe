# UltimateTicTacToe
## Proposal for Software Engineering Project
Group 11: Paige Huffman, Luke Malloy, Yunchao Zhang, Benjamin Krueger, and Drake Rastorfer

## Twist:
The twist we have decided to implement into Tic-Tac-Toe is what has been called Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe. This is a variety of Tic-Tac-Toe that has nine of the original boards set up in a three-by-three grid. This results in an overall nine-by-nine piece game board. The objective of this game is to get three in a row of the smaller grids. However, to obtain possession of a small grid, the player has to win the Tic-Tac-Toe game within the smaller grid.

## Game rules:
Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (UTTT) is played on a 3x3 meta-grid in which every box had been subdivided further into another three-by-three sub-grid. Much like normal TTT,  UTTT players take turns placing a marker in one of the sub-grid cells to try to get three in a row, however, this is further complicated by the rule stating that with each turn, the player must place his marker in the sub grid on the meta-grid corresponding to the last players move in the sub grid. Players will win sub grids when they get three in a row in each sub grid, and will win the overall game when they win three sub grids in a row on the meta grid.

## Timeline: 
**Turn in proposal**
